## Why this exists

Most token tools explain usage.

`token-receipt` itemizes the damage.

It turns invisible AI spend into a thermal-paper artifact you can paste into chat, screenshot instantly, and post with a straight face.

Three rules run the whole project:

- `Visual first`
  The output should look like checkout, not admin UI.
- `Data honest`
  Real local logs first. Official pricing second. Unknowns stay unknown.
- `Artifact over analytics`
  If it is not screenshot-worthy, it is not finished.

## How to trigger it

There are three ways to use `token-receipt`.

### 1. Trigger it inside chat

If you installed this repo as a skill, the normal path is not “open terminal and figure it out.”

The normal path is: say what you want in the chat box of the software you are already using.

Strong trigger phrases:

- `token receipt`
- `token bill`
- `usage receipt`
- `token 小票`
- `对话发票`
- `AI 用量账单`
- `把这次对话打成小票`
- `看看这轮 token 消耗`
- `查看本次对话 Token 消耗`

You can also be explicit about language:

- `token receipt in English`
- `中文版 token 小票`

### 2. Let Claude Code do it automatically

Claude Code can auto-print a receipt on `SessionEnd`.

Install the hook:

```bash
python3 scripts/install_claude_auto_trigger.py
```

After that, ending a Claude Code session will auto-fire the receipt without an extra chat message.

### 3. Run the CLI directly

If you are not invoking it through a skill system, run the script yourself:

```bash
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool codex
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool claude-code
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool kimi-code
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool opencode
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool claude-code --language zh-CN
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --session ~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db --opencode-session-id ses_xxx --agent-tool opencode
```


Trigger matrix:

| Software | Manual trigger in chat | Auto trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | Say `token receipt` or equivalent | Not shipped |
| Claude Code | Say `token receipt` or equivalent | `SessionEnd` hook after install |
| Trae | Say `token receipt` or equivalent | Not shipped |
| Kimi Code | Say `token receipt` or equivalent; CLI `--agent-tool kimi-code` | Not shipped |
| OpenCode | Say `token receipt` or equivalent; CLI `--agent-tool opencode` | Not shipped |

---

## The footer is the feature

The footer is not decoration.
It is the coup de grace.

This project is built around the idea that the last line on the receipt should feel like the model watched you spend context on one more revision and decided to leave a note.

Examples:

- `THE LOGO LOOKS CALM. THE BILL DOES NOT.`
- `REASONING WAS BILLED SEPARATELY.`
- `THE LAST REVISION WAS NOT THE LAST.`
- `画面稳了，预算死了。`
- `最后一版这个词，本来就不诚实。`

If the receipt looks good but the footer has no sting, the job is not done.

---

## Software support

It bills the software you are actually using.
It does not quietly switch to another app's newer logs.

| Software | Status | Data source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `supported now` | Codex JSONL sessions | Reads local session logs directly |
| Claude Code | `supported now` | Claude usage-data + projects | Uses usage logs for tokens and transcripts for model lookup |
| Trae | `manual mode now` | Trae app storage | Auto transcript import is not shipped yet |
| Kimi Code | `supported now` | kimi-cli `context.jsonl` (`~/.kimi/sessions/` or `KIMI_SHARE_DIR`) | Reads cumulative `_usage.token_count`; USD estimate omitted (no API split); use manual flags if you need priced input/output |
| OpenCode | `supported now` | `opencode*.db` SQLite under `~/.local/share/opencode/` (see `OPENCODE_DATA_DIR`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`) | Reads `session`/`message` rows (`message.data` JSON: `tokens`, `modelID`); supports `--scope latest-turn` \| `session` |

Notes:

- Some Trae builds use `Trae CN` / `.trae-cn` instead of `Trae`.
- Inside Codex, the runtime can be detected and `token-receipt` reads Codex logs.
- Inside Claude Code's SessionEnd hook, `token-receipt` reads Claude Code usage logs.
- If you run the script from a plain shell and more than one local software log exists, pass `--agent-tool` explicitly. Cross-software guessing is intentionally disabled.
- In current releases, `--agent-tool trae` is honest: it tells you to use manual mode instead of pretending Trae has clean JSONL session logs.

---

## Model coverage

There are two layers of support:

1. `Receipt rendering`
   Any model name can be rendered in manual mode.
2. `Price estimation`
   Cost only shows up when the model exists in `references/pricing.json`.

Current mapped model families include:

- `OpenAI`
  GPT-5 family, Codex family, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, `o3`, `o4-mini`
- `Anthropic`
  Claude Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku families
- `Google`
  Gemini 2.x and 3.x families
- `Moonshot`
  Kimi K2 family
- `DeepSeek`
  DeepSeek V4 family
- `Alibaba`
  Qwen family
- `Zhipu`
  GLM family
- `Xiaomi`
  MiMo family
- `MiniMax`
  M2 family

If your model is not mapped yet, the receipt still renders.
The price just refuses to roleplay.

---

## What it actually reads

Current receipts intentionally stay conservative about what they print:

- `Input Tokens`
- `Output Tokens`
- `Cache Read Tokens`
- `TOTAL`
- `Reasoning Tokens` when actually available
- `Cache Write Tokens` when actually available

That policy is deliberate.

Better to omit a field than lie with confidence.

---

## Quick start

No package manager is required right now.
It runs on Python's standard library.

```bash
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py
```

If you run that inside Codex or Claude Code, the current software can be detected automatically.
If you run it from a plain shell with multiple local software logs present, add `--agent-tool`.

Useful software-specific examples:

```bash
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool codex
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool claude-code
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool codex --scope session
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool claude-code --show-fields
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool trae --provider openai --model gpt-5.4 --input-tokens 12487 --output-tokens 3215
```

Useful rendering variants:

```bash
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --width 48 --stream
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool codex --language en
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool claude-code --language zh-CN
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool claude-code --output html --write ./receipt.html
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool claude-code --session ~/.claude/usage-data/session-meta/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.json --write /tmp/token-receipt.txt
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --footer-tone snarky --conversation-summary "one more revision for visual polish"
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --provider anthropic --agent-tool claude-code --model claude-sonnet-4.5 --input-tokens 12487 --cached-input-tokens 8742 --output-tokens 3215
```

Inside Claude Code skills, `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` resolves to the current Claude session.

What those flags mean in plain English:

- `--agent-tool codex`
  Read Codex data and use the Codex receipt header.
- `--agent-tool claude-code`
  Read Claude Code data and use the Claude Code receipt header.
- `--agent-tool trae`
  Use Trae branding. For now, bring your own token counts.
- `--show-fields`
  Ask the logs what they can actually prove.
- `--language en`
  Print the English receipt.
- `--language zh-CN`
  Print the Chinese receipt without forking the layout.
- `--output html`
  Export a browser-printable receipt page instead of the monospace text artifact.
- `--write /tmp/token-receipt.txt`
  Save the receipt quietly instead of dumping it into Bash stdout. This is the cleaner path inside Claude Code chat.
- `--write-html /tmp/token-receipt.html`
  Keep the text receipt as the main artifact, but also save a printable HTML copy that can be linked back in hosts that support local file links.
- `--stream`
  Print like a machine that knows you spent too much.

---

## Printable HTML

The main artifact is still the monospace receipt inside chat.

HTML is the secondary route: useful when you want browser print preview, real printer output, or a cleaner handoff to thermal-printer workflows.

```bash
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool claude-code --output html --write ./receipt.html
```

Open `receipt.html` in a browser, hit `Print receipt`, and let the browser talk to the printer.

If your host can render local file links, the cleaner flow is dual export:

```bash
python3 scripts/token_receipt.py --agent-tool claude-code --write /tmp/token-receipt.txt --write-html /tmp/token-receipt.html
```

That keeps the monospace receipt in chat while also giving you a clickable printable HTML file.

The current HTML path is tuned for the same three things people actually notice:

- a gray preview stage with a white receipt body, so the receipt edges stay visible on screen
- a pure white print result, so the browser preview does not lie about the final paper
- software-aware logos in HTML too: Claude Code uses a dedicated vector mark, while Codex and Trae use embedded image assets

---

## Claude Code auto-trigger

Install:

```bash
python3 scripts/install_claude_auto_trigger.py
```

Uninstall:

```bash
python3 scripts/uninstall_claude_auto_trigger.py
```

This wires `token-receipt` into Claude Code's `SessionEnd` hook.

The conversation ends.
The receipt arrives.
The denial window closes.

---

## Design philosophy

This project is intentionally opinionated.

- No markdown tables as the primary artifact
- No QR code for now
- No made-up token fields just because another tool exposes them
- No pretending platform-routed pricing is a direct vendor bill
- No sanding away the weird, uncomfortable energy of a real receipt

If the output feels too clean, it probably stopped feeling true.

---

## Validation

Before shipping changes, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_receipt.py
```

It checks things like:

- line width
- required fields
- logo alignment
- barcode presence
- pricing fallbacks
- unsupported field leakage

---

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](/Users/cecilialiu/Documents/Codex/token-receipt/CHANGELOG.md) for the running update log.

---

## Roadmap

- `Shipped now`
  Printable HTML export for browser print preview and physical receipt workflows.
- `Next up`
  Printer-first presets for common paper widths and cleaner print defaults.
- `Also planned`
  Trae automatic session import once its local storage shape is stable enough to trust.

---

## One-line thesis

Every prompt leaves a tab.

`token-receipt` just prints it before you can emotionally recover.
